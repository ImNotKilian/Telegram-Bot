# v5.0.0-alpha.1

## Changes:

* Subtly changed some signatures.
* Removed `Router` and most deprecated methods.
* `reply*` methods now set `reply_to_message_id`.
* Rewritten `core/network/client.ts`. As a result:
	- Files are uploaded differently than before v4.10.
	- Added `Telegram::use` for installing API transformers.
	- Replaced `Telegraf.Options['telegram']` with `Telegraf.Options['client']`.

## Planned:

* `composer.ts`, `scenes/`, `telegraf.ts` rework.
* Fixing issues.
* Deno support.
